# Task-Fragmentation

My Pick - Fragmentation of Functionality / UI

My choice is to fragment based on functionality and UI. This approach enhances readability, maintainability, and testability. It promotes separation of concerns, reusability of code, and easier debugging. It also improves scalability, making it simpler to add or modify features as the application grows.

## My Reasons for Fragmenting it like that

The main reason for fragmenting the code into smaller components and hooks is to improve readability, maintainability, and testability. Here are some specific reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component and hook has a specific purpose. This makes it easier to understand what each part of the code does. For example, the `BurnButtonBar` component is only responsible for rendering the burn button and handling its logic.

2. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused in different parts of the application. This reduces code duplication and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

3. **Testability**: Smaller components and hooks are easier to test. You can write unit tests for each component and hook to ensure they work correctly in isolation.

4. **Ease of Debugging**: If there's a bug in the application, it's easier to pinpoint the source of the problem when the code is divided into smaller, manageable pieces.

5. **Scalability**: As the application grows, it's easier to add new features or modify existing ones when the code is well-structured and divided into components and hooks.

By fragmenting the code in this way, we can create a more robust, scalable, and maintainable application.
